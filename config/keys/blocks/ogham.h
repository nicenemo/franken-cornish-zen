 * Block Description:
 * Ogham (also ogam and ogom , / ˈ ɒ ɡ əm / OG -əm , Modern Irish : ;
 * Middle Irish : ogum, ogom , later ogam ) is an Early Medieval alphabet
 * used primarily to write the early Irish language (in the "orthodox"
 * inscriptions , 4th to 6th centuries AD), and later the Old Irish
 * language ( scholastic ogham , 6th to 9th centuries). There are roughly
 * 400 surviving orthodox inscriptions on stone monuments throughout
 * Ireland and western Britain, the bulk of which are in southern areas
 * of the Irish province of Munster . The Munster counties of Cork and
 * Kerry contain 60% of all Irish ogham stones. The largest number
 * outside Ireland are in Pembrokeshire , Wales.
 * The inscriptions usually consist of personal names written in a set
 * formula.
