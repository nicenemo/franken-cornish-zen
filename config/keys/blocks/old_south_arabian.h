 * Block Description:
 * Ancient South Arabian ( ASA ; also known as Old South Arabian ,
 * Epigraphic South Arabian , Ṣayhadic , or Yemenite ) is a group of four
 * closely related extinct languages ( Sabaean/Sabaic , Qatabanic ,
 * Hadramitic , Minaic ) spoken in the far southern portion of the
 * Arabian Peninsula . The earliest preserved records belonging to the
 * group are dated to the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE. They were
 * written in the Ancient South Arabian script .
 * There were a number of other Old South Arabian languages (e.g.
 * Awsānian), of which very little evidence has survived, however. A set
 * of possible surviving Sayhadic languages is attested in the Razihi
 * language , Rijal Alma language , and Faifi language spoken in far
 * north-west of Yemen and far south-west of Saudi Arabia , though these
 * varieties of speech have both Arabic and Sayhadic features, and it is
 * difficult to classify them as either Arabic dialects with a Sayhadic
 * substratum , or Sayhadic languages that have been restructured under
 * pressure of Arabic.
