 * Block Description:
 * Counting Rod Numerals is a Unicode block containing traditional
 * Chinese counting rod symbols, which mathematicians used for
 * calculation in ancient China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. The
 * orientation of the Unicode characters follows Song dynasty convention,
 * with digits represented as horizontal lines, and tens represented as
 * vertical lines, which differs from Han dynasty practice which
 * represented digits as vertical lines, and tens as horizontal lines.
 * The block also contains five ideographic tally marks , based on the
 * five strokes of the character 正 , which are widely used in East Asia.
 * There are also two characters for use in representing traditional
 * European tally marks (only Tally Mark One and Tally Mark Five are
 * encoded, with tally numbers two through four intended to be
 * represented as a sequence of two through four Tally Mark One
 * characters).
