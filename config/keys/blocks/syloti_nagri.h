 * Block Description:
 * Sylheti Nagri or Sylheti Nāgarī ( Bengali : সিলেটী নাগরি, Sylheti :
 * ꠍꠤꠟꠐꠤ ꠘꠣꠉꠞꠤ , síloṭi nagri , pronounced ), known in classical
 * manuscripts as Sylhet Nagri ( ꠍꠤꠟꠦꠐ ꠘꠣꠉꠞꠤ ) as well as by many other
 * names , is an Indic script . The script was historically used in the
 * regions of Bengal and Assam , that were east of the Padma . It was
 * primarily used in the eastern part of the Sylhet region , to document
 * poetry known as puthis . In the course of the twentieth century, it
 * has lost much ground to the standardised Eastern Nagari script .
 * Printing presses for Sylheti Nagri existed as late as into the 1970s,
 * and in the 2000s, the script was added to the Unicode Basic
 * Multilingual Plane ( BMP ). (See Syloti Nagri (Unicode block) for more
 * details.)
 * Historically the script was transcribed in Middle Bengali , though
 * having similar characteristics to the more popular Dobhashi literary
 * dialect, it was distinguished for its phonological influence from
 * Sylheti . It is also claimed that the orthography of the script
 * equates with Sylheti, reflecting the phonetic and grammatical features
 * of the vernacular, it provided a simpler and more precise
 * representation than the more prevalent Bengali script . Sylheti Nagri
 * therefore represented a unique literary culture of the Sylhet region.
 * Contemporarily, the script is being revived by some as a key identity
 * marker of Sylhet's cultural heritage.
