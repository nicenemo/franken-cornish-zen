 *
 * Block Description:
 * Ideographic Description Characters is a Unicode block containing
 * graphic characters used for describing CJK ideographs . They are used
 * in Ideographic Description Sequences (IDS) to provide a description of
 * an ideograph, in terms of what other ideographs make it up and how
 * they are laid out relative to one another. An IDS provides the reader
 * with a description of an ideograph that cannot be represented
 * properly, usually because it is not encoded in Unicode; rendering
 * systems are not intended to automatically compose the pieces into a
 * complete ideograph, and the descriptions are not standardized.
 * U+2FF0 to U+2FFB were introduced from GBK ; U+2FFC to U+2FFF were
 * devised later and introduced in Unicode 15.1 (2023).
