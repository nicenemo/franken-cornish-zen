 * Block Description:
 * Latin Extended-G is a Unicode block containing additional characters
 * for phonetic transcription . The Latin Extended-F and -G blocks
 * contain the first Latin characters defined outside of the Basic
 * Multilingual Plane (BMP). They were created for Unicode version 14 in
 * 2021.
 * Because this is a recently created block, font support is poor. Fonts
 * that support at least some of Latin Extended-G include Gentium ,
 * Andika , Symbola , Unifont , Charis SIL , Noto Sans , Noto Serif , and
 * AncientSans .
