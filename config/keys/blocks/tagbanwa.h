 * Block Description:
 * The Tagbanwa people ( Tagbanwa : ᝦᝪᝯ ) are an indigenous people and
 * one of the oldest ethnic groups in the Philippines , mainly found in
 * central and northern Palawan . Research has shown that the Tagbanwa
 * are possible descendants of the Tabon Man , thus making them one of
 * the original inhabitants of the Philippines. They are a brown-skinned,
 * slim, and straight-haired ethnic group.
 * There are two major classifications based on the geographical location
 * where they can be found. Central Tagbanwas are found in the western
 * and eastern coastal areas of central Palawan. They are concentrated in
 * the municipalities of Aborlan , Quezon , and Puerto Princesa .
 * Calamian Tagbanwa , on the other hand, are found in Baras coast,
 * Busuanga Island , Coron Island and in some parts of El Nido . These
 * two Tagbanwa subgroups speak the same languages but different tone and
 * pronunciation and do not exactly have the same customs. The Tagbanwa
 * are believed to have descended from the Tabon Man, making them one of
 * the original inhabitants of the Philippines. They have a long history
 * of resistance against foreign invaders, from the Spanish colonial
 * period to the American era.
