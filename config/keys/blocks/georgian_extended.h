 *
 * Block Description:
 * Georgian Extended is a Unicode block containing Georgian Mtavruli (
 * Georgian : მთავრული , "title" or "heading") letters that function as
 * uppercase versions of their Mkhedruli counterparts in the Georgian
 * block . Unlike all other casing scripts in Unicode, there is no title
 * casing between Mkhedruli and Mtavruli letters, because Mtavruli is
 * typically used only in all-caps text, although there have been some
 * historical attempts at capitalization.
 * The following Unicode-related documents record the purpose and process
 * of defining specific characters in the Georgian Extended block:
 *
 * Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_Extended
 *
 * Unicode Charts: https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1C90.pdf
 
* Consistency Check:
* Total Defined Code Points: 46
* Total Significant Hex Values: 46
* Status: OK (Counts Match)
