 * Block Description:
 * Old Persian is one of two directly attested Old Iranian languages (the
 * other being Avestan ) and is the ancestor of Middle Persian (the
 * language of the Sasanian Empire ). Like other Old Iranian languages,
 * it was known to its native speakers as ariya (Iranian). Old Persian is
 * close to both Avestan and Vedic Sanskrit , and all three languages are
 * highly inflected .
 * Old Persian appears primarily in the inscriptions, clay tablets and
 * seals of the Achaemenid era ( c. 600 BCE to 300 BCE). Examples of Old
 * Persian have been found in what is now Iran , Romania ( Gherla ),
 * Armenia , Bahrain , Iraq , Turkey and Egypt , with the most important
 * attestation by far being the contents of the Behistun Inscription
 * (dated to 522 BCE).
