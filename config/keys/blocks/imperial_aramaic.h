 * Block Description:
 * Imperial Aramaic is a linguistic term, coined by modern scholars in
 * order to designate a specific historical variety of Aramaic language .
 * The term is polysemic , with two distinctive meanings, wider (
 * sociolinguistic ) and narrower ( dialectological ). Since most
 * surviving examples of the language have been found in Egypt, the
 * language is also referred to as Egyptian Aramaic .
 * Some scholars use the term as a designation for a distinctive,
 * socially prominent phase in the history of Aramaic language, that
 * lasted from the middle of the 8th century BCE to the end of the 4th
 * century BCE and was marked by the use of Aramaic as a language of
 * public life and administration in the late Neo-Assyrian Empire and its
 * successor states, the Neo-Babylonian Empire and the Achaemenid Empire
 * , also adding to that some later (Post-Imperial) uses that persisted
 * throughout the early Hellenistic period. Other scholars use the term
 * Imperial Aramaic in a narrower sense, reduced only to the Achaemenid
 * period, basing that reduction on several strictly linguistic
 * distinctions between the previous (Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian)
 * phase and later (more prominent) Achaemenid phase.
